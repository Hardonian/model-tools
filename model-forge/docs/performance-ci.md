## 1. Why Performance CI?

Standard software CI gates check unit tests, linting, and security vulnerabilities. However, in generative AI systems:

- A new quantization kernel might silently introduce a 15% latency penalty.
- A tokenizer change might cause context padding to blow up KV cache memory.
- A serving engine bump might regress P95 Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 40%.

ModelForge Performance CI acts as an **automated performance regression firewall** in your pull request workflow.

## 2. Configuration (`.modelforge.yml`)

```yaml
version: 1

model:
  repo: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct"
  revision: "main"

workloads:
  - name: "customer-support-rag"
    task_type: "rag"
    context_length: 4096
    concurrency: 8
    target_ttft_ms: 350

hardware:
  primary: "NVIDIA L40S 48GB"

thresholds:
  throughput_regression_percent: 5.0 # Fail if tok/s drops > 5%
  ttft_regression_percent: 10.0 # Fail if P95 TTFT rises > 10%
  vram_regression_percent: 8.0 # Fail if peak VRAM increases > 8%
```

## 3. GitHub Actions Workflow

Add `.github/workflows/modelforge-performance.yml` to your repo:

```yaml
name: ModelForge Performance CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  performance-gate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3
      - run: uv pip install -e packages/benchmark-cli
      - run: modelforge ci check --config .modelforge.yml
```

## 4. Pull Request Comment Output

When running in CI, ModelForge posts a markdown table to the GitHub pull request:

| Metric                 | Baseline | Current Run | Delta % | Threshold       | Status      |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| **Throughput (tok/s)** | 72.4     | 71.0        | -1.9%   | -5.0% max drop  | ✅ **PASS** |
| **P95 TTFT (ms)**      | 280.0    | 290.0       | +3.5%   | +10.0% max rise | ✅ **PASS** |
| **Peak VRAM (GB)**     | 38.6     | 38.8        | +0.5%   | +8.0% max rise  | ✅ **PASS** |

If any regression exceeds its configured threshold, the job exits with non-zero status code `1`, blocking the merge.
