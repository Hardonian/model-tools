## 1. Motivation

In the open-source LLM ecosystem, a repository identifier like `Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct` is **not static**. Model maintainers continuously push updated checkpoint commits, convert tokenizer configurations, add quantized branches, or modify chat templates.

Furthermore, serving teams routinely run into unverified runtime claims:

- _"Does this model support vLLM continuous batching?"_
- _"Does it run in FP8 on Ada L40S?"_
- _"Can I deploy this on NVIDIA Dynamo with disaggregated prefill/decode?"_
- _"Will this run within 24GB VRAM?"_

A **Compute Passport** is a cryptographically verifiable, revision-specific deployment specification that certifies exact model identity, empirical execution compatibility across runtimes, memory profiles across precisions, and benchmark evidence coverage.

---

## 2. Canonical Identity

Every Compute Passport is strictly anchored to:

```text
{organization}/{model_name}@{revision}
```

Example:
`Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct@main` or `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B@1e42f9b...`

Treating `org/model` as sufficient without revision tracking is explicitly prohibited by ModelForge schema integrity rules.

## 3. Evidence Provenance Tiers

Every compatibility claim and performance metric in a Compute Passport declares its provenance:

| Provenance Level | Description                                                                                                | Trust Weight |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **`MEASURED`**   | Multi-run empirical telemetry executed on real physical accelerators by verified OpenComputeBench workers. | **1.00**     |
| **`DOCUMENTED`** | Official vendor support statements, framework release notes, or tested architectural PRs.                  | **0.85**     |
| **`DERIVED`**    | Analytically calculated using GPU memory models, tensor parallelism rules, and roofline formulas.          | **0.70**     |
| **`PREDICTED`**  | Machine-learning regression estimated from adjacent parameter architectures.                               | **0.50**     |
| **`UNKNOWN`**    | Untested runtime or accelerator configuration.                                                             | **0.00**     |
