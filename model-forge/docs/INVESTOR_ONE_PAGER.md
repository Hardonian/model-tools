## The Open Deployment Intelligence Layer Between AI Models and Production Compute

---

## The Market Inefficiency

Global enterprise spend on AI compute is accelerating past **$100B annually**, yet **over 40% of GPU compute is wasted** due to suboptimal model deployment configurations, over-provisioning, and avoidable out-of-memory crashes.

Today, there are over **1.5 million open models on Hugging Face**. When an enterprise team downloads open weights (e.g. Llama 3.3, DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5), they face an expensive trial-and-error dilemma:

- Which accelerator (H100, L40S, RTX 4090, MI300X) delivers the best cost-to-latency ratio?
- What runtime (vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, NVIDIA Dynamo, NIM) meets their Time-To-First-Token SLA?
- How can they avoid renting oversized GPU instances?

## The Solution: ModelForge

ModelForge is the **deployment intelligence layer** that translates model architectures and latency SLOs into mathematically optimal, reproducible deployment configurations.

```text
HUGGING FACE MODEL → EXACT REVISION → COMPUTE PASSPORT → WORKLOAD → SLO
  → DEPLOYMENT PLAN → EVIDENCE → ARTIFACT → BENCHMARK → REPRODUCTION
```

### Core Product Capabilities

1. **Compute Passports**: Revision-specific hardware compatibility, memory footprints, and deterministic confidence scoring.
2. **Inference SLO Compiler**: Multi-objective Pareto optimizer ranking hardware topologies by cost and latency.
3. **Turnkey Deployment Manifests**: Generates validated Docker Compose, Kubernetes CRDs (NVIDIA Dynamo), and vLLM launch scripts.
4. **OpenComputeBench & Failure Corpus**: Verifiable benchmark network and negative-result intelligence preventing costly OOM errors.
5. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Native integration with AI coding agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code).

## Business Model & Commercial Monetization

1. **Open Source Core (Free & Permissive)**:
   OpenComputeBench dataset (CDLA-Permissive-2.0), CLI runner, MCP server, and public web explorer to drive developer standard adoption.
2. **ModelForge Team & Enterprise SaaS ($499 - $3,500/mo)**:
   Private workload fingerprinting, CI/CD regression gates, internal cluster hardware optimization, and custom benchmark harness execution.
3. **Infrastructure Cloud Partnerships & Placement**:
   Integration with GPU cloud providers (CoreWeave, Lambda, Nebius, Scaleway) to direct optimized deployment manifests to reserve compute.
